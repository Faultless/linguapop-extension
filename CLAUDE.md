# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

LinguaPop is a Japanese language-learning novel reader. Users import EPUB/TXT files (or a paired original+translation), and read them with switchable view modes (original / translated / parallel), per-token JLPT color coding for Japanese, tap-for-dictionary, select-for-translation, custom themes, multiple layouts, TTS, and fullscreen.

**This is a Flutter port.** The repo was previously a React/TypeScript monorepo (extension + web + mobile + landing); that code now lives in `legacy_ts/` and is kept only as a reference during the port. It is **not** built or shipped.

## Targets

Single Flutter codebase, three runtime targets:

- **Android** — primary target. Native back-button navigation, edge-to-edge system bars, MeCab tokenizer bundled natively.
- **Linux desktop** — same code, runs as a native desktop app.
- **Web** — Flutter web build. MeCab is unavailable here; the tokenizer falls back to a degraded mode (planned).

No iOS scaffold (can be added later with `flutter create . --platforms ios`).

## Architecture

### State management

Riverpod (`flutter_riverpod`). One `StateNotifier` per persistent domain:

- `ReaderPrefsNotifier` — every reader pref, serializes to `Storage.prefs()['reader_prefs']` as JSON.
- `NovelsNotifier` — library `NovelMeta[]` list, plus body load/save methods. Bodies are stored per-id in `Storage.novelBody()` so the meta list stays small.
- `VocabNotifier` — flat `VocabEntry[]`, dedup keyed on `(base, isPhrase)`.

`activeThemeProvider` derives the current `ReaderTheme` from `readerPrefsProvider`. `MaterialApp.router` consumes it so theme changes propagate instantly.

### Storage layout (Hive)

| Box           | Key                  | Value                              |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `prefs`       | `reader_prefs`       | JSON-encoded `ReaderPrefs`         |
| `novels_meta` | `list`               | JSON list of `NovelMeta`           |
| `novel_body`  | `{novelId}`          | JSON `NovelBody`                   |
| `jpdict`      | `{query}`            | JSON `DictResult` (infinite cache) |
| `vocab`       | `list`               | JSON list of `VocabEntry`          |
| `covers`      | `{novelId}`          | base64-encoded local cover image bytes |

The `prefs` box also holds key `collections` (JSON list of `Collection`) for user-defined library shelves.

Logical equivalents of the legacy JS localStorage/IndexedDB layout — same JSON shape so future migration tooling is straightforward.

### Navigation

`go_router` with all routes nested under `/`. Android system back button works out of the box — `MaterialApp.router` wires up the Navigator pop chain. Routes:

- `/` — Library
- `/book/:novelId` — Book detail (cover/rating-less metadata edit, collections, tags, cover picker)
- `/reader/:novelId` — Reader (`?ch=N` query param deep-links to a chapter, used by the news hub)
- `/news` — News hub (all imported feed articles: day grouping, read state, difficulty, sync)
- `/reader/:novelId/settings` — Reader settings (also `/settings`)
- `/import` — File-picker import flow (stub)
- `/vocab` — Saved vocab list
- `/sources` — Online source adapters (stub)

### Theming

`ReaderTheme.toThemeData()` produces a Material 3 `ThemeData` seeded from the theme's accent color and overriding `surface`/`onSurface` with the theme's bg/fg. App-wide theme is whatever the user picked in `prefs.themeId`. AppBar / BottomSheet / Card / ListTile inherit through standard Material theming — no per-widget inline colors needed.

### List view modes

Library and news screens share a `LibraryViewMode { grid, list, card }` (persisted in `ReaderPrefs.libraryViewMode` / `newsViewMode`), toggled via `ViewModeButton` in each app bar:
- **grid** ("Media") — cover/image-forward tiles. Library shows `NovelCard` (cover + clamped 2-line title + author; tags intentionally omitted here to avoid grid-cell overflow). News shows 16:9 image cards.
- **list** — compact rows. `NovelListRow` (46px cover thumb + title/author/clamped tag row) and the news `_ArticleRow` (title + source·time + difficulty bar + small lead thumb).
- **card** ("Cards") — full-width rich cards. `NovelWideCard` (64px cover + title + author + tag wrap + progress) and a taller news row with a 2-line snippet and an 84px image.

All entry widgets clamp text with `maxLines`+ellipsis and wrap variable rows (title beside badges, source/time beside difficulty) in `Expanded`/`Flexible`, so long titles or tag lists can't overflow. Tag rows clamp to a fixed count with a `+N` indicator.

News lead images (`Chapter.imageUrl`) are lazy: `NewsThumb` uses `Image.network` (streamed + ImageCache-backed) with a `cacheWidth` cap and fade-in, falling back silently to a glyph on error/no-image, so images never block list scrolling. `imageUrl` is captured at import time — from each adapter's article `og:image` (`ogImage()` in `rss.dart`), falling back to the feed stub's image; threaded through `SourceImporter.importArticle`.

### Transient feedback

`MiniToast.show(context, msg)` (`lib/ui/widgets/mini_toast.dart`) is a tiny bottom-left overlay toast that fades in/out almost instantly (~90ms in, ~650ms hold, ~180ms out) and replaces itself in place. Used for low-importance confirmations in the sources browser ("Adding…", "Added ✓", "Removed") instead of full-width SnackBars. Failures still use a SnackBar so they're dismissible and visible.

### Library organization

Kindle-style classification on top of `NovelMeta`:
- **Cover art**: `lib/services/covers/cover_service.dart` queries the Google Books Volumes API (no key, `package:http` so it works on web too — unlike the `dart:io` `SessionClient`). `NovelsNotifier.autoFetchCover(id)` runs best-effort on import for books with no embedded cover. The book detail screen's cover picker also offers online search, paste-URL, and pick-from-device. Device-picked images are stored as base64 in the `covers` box and referenced by a `local:{novelId}` `coverUrl`; `BookCover` renders the three cases (`local:` → `Image.memory`, remote/`data:` → `Image.network`, none → procedural) and watches `coverRevisionProvider` so a freshly-picked cover repaints.
- **Collections**: user-named shelves. `Collection` model + `collectionsProvider` (persisted in the `prefs` box under `collections`). Books reference them by id via `NovelMeta.collectionIds`, so renaming never rewrites the meta list. Library has a Collection filter chip.
- **Favorites**: `NovelMeta.favorite` (heart toggle in detail + a Favorites filter chip; heart overlay on the grid card).
- **Continue reading**: `NovelMeta.lastReadAt` (bumped by the reader's progress save) drives a horizontal "Continue reading" row at the top of the library, showing in-progress books most-recently-read first. Hidden when any filter is active.
- **Book detail screen**: `lib/ui/screens/book_detail_screen.dart` (`/book/:novelId`, opened by long-pressing a library card) hosts cover editing, favorite, collections, tags, content type, and remove.

### Japanese pipeline

- **Tokenizer**: `lib/services/tokenizer/` — abstract `JpTokenizer` with a conditional-import factory:
  - `mecab_tokenizer_native.dart` — wraps the vendored `plugins/mecab_dart` FFI plugin, bundles IPADIC from `assets/ipadic/` (~51 MB, copied to documents dir on first run), maps MeCab features to our `JpToken` model (base form, hiragana reading, POS, 活用型/活用形, filler flag).
  - `conjugation_merger.dart` — post-pass over the raw morphemes: merges verb/adjective stems with their auxiliary chain (て-connectors, 助動詞, 非自立 helper verbs, 接尾 voice suffixes) into one token per conjugated phrase, with a `ConjugationInfo` (form labels like progressive/polite/past/passive/causative + per-morpheme breakdown). Merged surfaces always concatenate back to the original text. Unit-tested against known IPADIC analyses in `test/conjugation_merger_test.dart`.
  - `mecab_tokenizer_stub.dart` — web fallback (returns the whole text as one filler token).
- **JLPT lookup**: `lib/services/dictionary/jlpt_lookup.dart`. Loads two bundled JSON assets at app start:
  - `assets/jlpt/vocab.json` — 8,034 entries from the open Tanos / Jonathan Waller list.
  - `assets/jlpt/starter.json` — 307 curated common keys (particles, kana words) keyed by comma-separated surfaces.
  Both are merged into a single `String → JlptHit` map. Duplicate keys keep the easier level. The `register()` method lets cached Jisho lookups merge in later.
- **JapaneseText widget**: `lib/ui/widgets/japanese_text.dart`. While the tokenizer is loading the text renders plain; once `tokenizerStatusProvider` flips to `ready` it retokenizes and renders each content token as a colored `TextSpan` with a dotted underline. Respects `prefs.coloriseJapanese` and the `prefs.jlptColorRules` POS×level matrix. `onTapToken` is wired but unused until the Jisho popover lands.
- **JLPT colors**: N5=teal, N4=green, N3=amber, N2=orange, N1=red (see `kJlptColors`).
- **Warm-up**: `LinguapopApp` reads `tokenizerStatusProvider.future` + `jlptLoadedProvider.future` in a post-frame callback so the first chapter open isn't blocked on a 51 MB asset copy.

**Native build notes** (Android, see `plugins/mecab_dart/`):
- The vendored plugin keeps the upstream FFI Dart side (`lib/mecab_dart.dart`) unchanged so future upstream merges stay easy. Only the Android Kotlin plugin (V1 → V2 embedding) and `build.gradle` (AGP 7.3 → 8.7, Kotlin 1.7 → 2.0, minSdk 21, namespace) were updated.
- MeCab's C++ uses `register` storage class, removed in C++17. `plugins/mecab_dart/android/CMakeLists.txt` pins to C++14 and adds `-Wno-register` so it builds against the modern NDK.

### Dictionary popover

- **Service**: `lib/services/dictionary/jisho_service.dart`. Calls Jisho's public JMdict-derived API, caches every successful query in the `jpdict` Hive box forever (offline fallback to cache on subsequent network failures), and feeds JLPT-tagged hits back into the in-memory `JlptLookup` via `register()` so previously-tapped words light up on the next read.
- **UI**: `lib/ui/widgets/word_popover.dart` — `showWordPopover()` opens a draggable bottom sheet with the headword, reading, base form, conjugation analysis for merged verb phrases (form-label chips + morpheme breakdown, e.g. 食べ + て + い + まし + た), every Jisho sense (parts of speech + glosses), JLPT badge, "common" badge, and a "Save to vocab" action that writes a `VocabEntry` attributed to the current novel + chapter.
- The reader's `JapaneseText` wires every colored token's `onTapToken` callback to this popover.

### Importers

`lib/services/import/` contains the ported flow:
- `epub_importer.dart` — `parseEpub(Uint8List)`. ZIP via `archive`, OPF/XHTML via `xml`. Pulls metadata (title, author, language, cover data URL), walks the spine, extracts visible text with block-level newline insertion. Falls back to a regex tag strip if XHTML is malformed.
- `txt_importer.dart` — `splitTxtIntoChapters(text)`. Same heuristic as the legacy (chapter regex → markdown headings → `---`/`***` → 3+ blank lines), single-chapter fallback.
- `novel_cleaner.dart` — `pruneNovel()` and `alignChapters()`.
- `jp_detect.dart` — `looksJapanese()`.
- `import_service.dart` — `ImportService.importFile()` orchestrates the whole flow (parse → prune → optional align → JP detection → write to library).
- UI: `lib/ui/screens/import_screen.dart` — file picker for original + optional paired translation; status snackbar; routes back to library on success.

### Translation

`lib/services/translation/translate_service.dart`:
- Paragraph → sentence → hard 4500-char chunking via `splitForTranslation()`.
- Provider chain: Google Translate `gtx` first (no key, returns JSON segments), LibreTranslate mirrors as fallback (argosopentech.com, libretranslate.de).
- Per-chunk progress callback for the reader's "Translate chapter" UI; `CancelToken` aborts mid-translation.
- Smoke-tested live: short and multi-paragraph Japanese translate cleanly.

Wired into the reader's bottom-bar Translate button: opens a non-dismissable progress sheet, persists the result onto the chapter, switches the view mode to parallel.

### Sources

`lib/services/sources/`:
- `source_types.dart` — abstract `FeedSource` / `SearchSource` interfaces, `BookStub`, `ArticleStub`, `ChapterStub`, `SearchQuery`, enums.
- `session_client.dart` — cookie-aware HTTP client built on `dart:io HttpClient`. Follows redirects manually so cookies set mid-chain survive (NHK Easy's `/tix/build_authorize` flow needs this). RFC-6265-ish domain matching so a cookie on `web.nhk` reaches `news.web.nhk`.
- `nhk_auth.dart` — the one-shot NHK handshake (`/tix/build_authorize`, `profileType=abroad`, Tokyo postal defaults), memoized per `SessionClient` and shared by both NHK adapters.
- `nhk_easy.dart` — feed adapter. Hits `top-list.json` with the JWT cookie from the handshake. Parses article HTML via the `html` package, strips `<rt>/<rp>` ruby.
- `nhk_news.dart` — regular NHK News Web feed adapter. Lists via the public RSS (`www3.nhk.or.jp/rss/news/cat0.xml`); article bodies live on `news.web.nhk/newsweb/na/na-{id}` and are only fully server-rendered with the handshake cookies. The newsweb pages use hashed CSS classes, so the body extractor self-calibrates: the first `<p>` after the `<h1>` is the lead, and every body paragraph shares its exact class attribute.
- `mainichi.dart` — Mainichi Shimbun breaking-news feed (RDF RSS + `section.articledetail-body` scrape). Premium articles are detected via the `cXenseParse:mai-fee-charging` meta and imported with their free portion plus a notice.
- `rss.dart` — minimal RSS 2.0 + RDF/RSS 1.0 item parser (incl. RFC-822 dates) shared by the feed adapters.
- `syosetu.dart` — search adapter. Calls `api.syosetu.com/novelapi/api/` with `order=hyoka` etc. Scrapes the `.p-eplist__sublist` TOC and `.p-novel__text` chapter body; 600 ms throttle between chapters.
- `source_registry.dart`, `source_import.dart`, `providers/sources_provider.dart`.
- `source_import.dart`'s `SourceImporter` handles both shapes:
  - Articles → append into a rolling `feed:<sourceId>` novel; dedup by `sourceUrl`.
  - Books → new novel with all chapters; reports progress through an `ImportTask` (with cancel).

UI: `lib/ui/screens/sources_screen.dart` — single search bar, source-filter chips generated from the registry, order + completion popup, articles + books mixed in one scroll. One-tap **+** button on every result imports (instant for articles, progress sheet for books); already-imported items show a checkmark that removes them on tap (with confirm). Article tiles show an approximate JLPT difficulty badge estimated from title + summary. Tap-through on books opens a detail bottom sheet with summary, tags, and a big "Add to library" button.

### News hub

`lib/ui/screens/news_screen.dart` (`/news`): every imported feed article across all news sources in one list — newest first, grouped by day, unread dots (`news_read_ids` in the prefs box via `newsReadProvider`), per-article JLPT difficulty badge + distribution bar (estimated from the full stored text), swipe-to-delete, source + unread filters, and a sync action that fetches the newest unimported articles from every feed source (capped at 10/source/pass). Tapping an article marks it read and deep-links into the reader at that chapter (`/reader/:id?ch=N`). `newsArticlesProvider` (in `lib/providers/news_provider.dart`) flattens the rolling feed novels and recomputes whenever the library changes.

### Difficulty estimation

`lib/services/dictionary/jlpt_estimator.dart` — tokenizes a text (first 4k chars) and buckets content words (noun/verb/adjective/adverb) against the JLPT table into `JlptStats`; `difficultyBucket` gives the closest level. Memoized per text. `DifficultyBadge` (`lib/ui/widgets/difficulty_badge.dart`) renders the estimate ("~N3" when approximate) and optionally a stacked N5…N1 share bar; renders nothing when the tokenizer is unavailable (web stub).

Smoke tests under `tool/` for offline verification:
- `dart run tool/smoke_sources.dart` — hits Syosetu search + chapter, NHK Easy list + article.
- `dart run tool/smoke_news_sources.dart` — lists + fetches the first article from all three news feeds (NHK Easy, NHK News, Mainichi).
- `dart run tool/smoke_translate.dart` — checks ja → en against gtx + the chunk splitter.

### Vocab export (AnkiDroid)

`lib/services/export/vocab_export.dart`:
- `toTsv(entries, opts)` — pure function. UTF‑8 TSV, columns: Front (kanji surface), Reading (kana), Back (semicolon-joined glosses), PartsOfSpeech, Example, Source (novel title + URL), Tags (space-separated, AnkiDroid convention). Tabs/newlines inside fields collapsed to spaces so every entry is exactly one row.
- `VocabExporter.exportAll(opts)` — writes a BOM-prefixed TSV to a temp file and hands it to `Share.shareXFiles`. AnkiDroid (and any other text-handling app) appears in the share sheet. After a successful share, every exported entry's `exportedAt` is bumped so subsequent "Export new since last" works.
- `ExportOptions { since, header }` — `since` filters to entries added after a timestamp; `header` prepends the column-name row.

UI: `lib/ui/screens/vocab_screen.dart` — sort menu (recent / alpha / JLPT level), text filter, swipe-to-delete with confirm, JLPT badge + cloud icon for previously-exported entries, share button in the AppBar that opens an export sheet with three options ("Everything", "New since last export", "Everything, with header row").

## Android build notes

The Android build needs a few compat shims (see `android/build.gradle.kts` and
`android/gradle.properties`):
- AGP 8 requires every Android library to declare a `namespace`; older plugins
  used the legacy `<manifest package="…">` attribute. We backfill it.
- Plugins may compile their Java side at a different JVM target than the
  Kotlin side; we align Kotlin to whatever the plugin's Java is set to.
- `minSdk = 21` (raised from Flutter's default 16) for native plugins that
  bundle NDK platform-21 code.

## Working with legacy_ts/

When porting a behavior, the legacy file is usually the canonical spec. Common lookups:

- Reader prefs defaults / theme list: `legacy_ts/packages/core/src/context/ReaderPrefsContext.tsx`, `legacy_ts/packages/core/src/data/readerThemes.ts`
- Data types: `legacy_ts/packages/core/src/data/types.ts`
- JLPT vocab table (~8k entries): `legacy_ts/packages/core/src/data/jlptVocab.full.ts`
- JP tokenizer: `legacy_ts/packages/core/src/utils/jpTokenizer.ts`
- Dictionary lookup: `legacy_ts/packages/core/src/utils/jpDictLookup.ts`
- JLPT stats: `legacy_ts/packages/core/src/utils/jlptStats.ts`
- Translation: search `legacy_ts/packages/core/src/utils/` for `translate`
- EPUB / TXT / cleaner: `legacy_ts/packages/core/src/sources/`
- Reader / Library / Settings React UI: `legacy_ts/packages/ui/src/`

`legacy_ts/` is gitignored at the `node_modules/` level — the source files are version controlled, the build artifacts are not.

## Conventions

- Use `flutter_riverpod` providers; do not call `Hive.box(...)` directly from widgets — go through providers.
- Models stay JSON-serializable via `toJson` / `fromJson` (no `hive_generator`). This makes export/import and migration trivial.
- New screens go in `lib/ui/screens/`; new shared widgets in `lib/ui/widgets/`.
- Strings are UI-only and inlined; we'll add i18n later if needed.
- Stick to Material 3 with the active theme's `ColorScheme`; avoid inline colors except where the design calls for the theme's literal bg/fg/accent.
